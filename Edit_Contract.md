# Edit a Contract


## Edit Clause Text

1. Click on a Clause Block. An editing toolbar and some saving options will appear.

2. Make necessary changes.

3. Click "Save Draft" or "Publish". 

4. Click "Save" in the pop-up. *WARNING*: When you save changes to a Clause Alternative in a Contract, that change will be immediately pushed to any other Contract that uses that specific Clause Alternative.

5. If the user does not want those changes pushed to other Contracts, click "New Alternative" in the pop-up. 

Creating a new Clause Alternative will take the user's edited text and bring up a "New Alternative" Form. Users can give this new Clause Alternative a different label, contract type, and party-weight. When the user saves the new Clause Alternative, that new text will be synced with the current Contract and the previously synced Clause Alterantive will remain as it was before the user made changes. This allow the user to make necessary changes to a Clause Alternative in one Contract without affecting the text in other Contracts.
