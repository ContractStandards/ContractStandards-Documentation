# Visualizations (*Smart Feature*)

The ContractStandards Visualization tool displays a bubble chart showing the commonality and consistency of clause types in a particular type of contract. These statistics are pulled from our machine learning software, KMAuthor.

1. Once logged in, navigate to the Admin View. See [Navigating the Site](Published_View_Navigation.md).
2. In the left side navigation bar, select "Visualizations"
3. On the Visualizations page, select a contract from the dropdown.
4. A bubble chart will load showing all clauses in that contract and their commonality (y-axis) and consistency (x-axis)

**How to read the bubble chart**

Users can divide the chart into quadrants:
* Top-left = high commonality, low consistency. These are clauses that appear often in this type of agreement but change from deal to deal. These clauses are likely highly negotiated.
* Top-right = high commonality, high consistency. These are clauses that appear often in the type of agreement and stay the same from deal to deal. These are generally boilerplate clauses like governing law or entire agreement.
* Bottom-left = low commonality, low consistency. These are clauses that do not appear very often. Also, when the clauses appear in a contract, they change from deal to deal.
* Bottom-right = low commonality, high consistency. These are clauses that do not appear very often but when they do, they are very consistent. These clauses are usually optional clauses that are markers of specific sub-types of that contract.
