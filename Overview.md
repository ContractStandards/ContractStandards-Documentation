# ContractStandards Overview

ContractStandards is a platform that allows organizations to create and maintain contract libraries. 

Traditionally, contract libraries have been collections of documents saved on an intranet. Maybe your organization has even gone so far as to track some of the different clauses in a spreadsheet somewhere. The problem with this system is that it is hard to update templates, reuse content across templates, or ensure that your team uses the content.

ContractStandards lets organizations create individual Clauses that can be synced across multiple Contracts. The Clauses in an organization's Private Library are the building blocks for the organization's Contracts.

This modular system has a few benefits over static content:

1. Clauses can easily be dropped into multiple documents and users can know where their Clauses are being used.
2. Update a Clause in one place and push that change out to every synced Contract.
3. As users build out Clause and Contract libraries, creating new Contracts is easier because they already have a whole library of pre-vetted content.
