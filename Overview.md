# ContractStandards Overview

ContractStandards is a platform that allows organizations to create and maintain Contract libraries. 

Traditionally, template libraries have been collections of documents saved on an intranet. Maybe your organization has even gone so far as to track some of the different clauses in a spreadsheet somewhere. The problem with this system is that it is hard to update templates, reuse content across templates, or ensure that your team uses the content.

ContractStandards lets organizations create individual Clauses that can be synced across multiple Contracts. The Clauses in an organization's Private Library are the building blocks for the organization's Contracts.
