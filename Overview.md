# ContractStandards Overview

ContractStandards is a platform that allows organizations to create and maintain their own template libraries. To take full advantage of the site, users may need to adjust their thinking a little. 

Traditionally, template libraries have been collections of whole documents saved on an intranet. Maybe your organization has even gone so far as to track some of the different clauses in a spreadsheet somewhere. The problem with this system is that it is hard to update templates, reuse content across templates, or ensure that your team uses the content.
