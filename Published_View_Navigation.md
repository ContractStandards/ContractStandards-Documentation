# Navigating ContractStandards

## Generally Getting Around

ContractStandards is organized into Contract, Clause, and Checklist libraries. Users can access each library from the navbar at the top of every screen. Users can also search the site for any content from the search field in the navbar.

## Content Libraries

Each library contains a list of content down the middle. Users simply click on content to access that page. Each Contract, Clause, or Checklist is labelled with the date updated, organization it belongs to (Public content not labelled), and content classification.

On the left side of each library are a search field, sort options, and filter options.

## The Admin View

The Admin View is where users with the proper permissions can go to edit content and manage their Private Library.

### Getting to the Admin View

1. In the top-right corner, click on the user's username.

2. In the username menu, click "Admin View."

### Navigating the Admin View

Users can pull up the navigation elements in the Admin View by clicking on the icon in the top-left corner. That icon pulls up a side drawer the user can use to get around. This documentation can help you understand what each element does, if it is not immediately apparent.
