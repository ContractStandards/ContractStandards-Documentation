# Commenting on Content

If Comments are enabled in a Private Library, users will be able to comment and rate Contracts and Clauses. See [Organizational Management](Organization_Management.md) for information on enabling Comments.

Comments are intended to allow users to share guidance on content. They are not necessarily intended for use in the editing content. Think less track changes and more chat room.

## Comments in Contracts

1. Navigate to the relevant Contract.

2. On the right side of the screen, the user will have options to open "Guide," "Assembly," and "Comments" sections. Click "Comments."

3. Under the "Comment" button will be a field for the user to enter a comment and a feed of all other comments from users in the Private Library.

4. Enter a comment in the field that says "Add a Comment."

5. Press Enter

6. The user's comment will appear at the top of the feed below.

7. Under the user's comments are options to Reply, Like, Edit, or Delete.

## Comments in Clauses

1. Navigate to the relevant Clause.

2. On the right side of the screen, there are two tabs: "Resources" and "Comments". Click on "Comments".
