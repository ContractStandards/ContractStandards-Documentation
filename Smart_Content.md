# Smart Content

ContractStandards can be linked with our contract analytics software to give users added functionality such as Harmonization and Visualization. This linking can show users how standard language in the user's Private Library compares to legacy contract language (Harmonization) or generate visualizations on which types of clauses are generally boilerplate, highly negotiated, or optional, deal-specific clauses (Visualization).

Enabling these features currently requires engaging ContractStandards to run the analytics on an organization's legacy contracts. Email us a sales@kmstandards.com to discuss this process and additional costs.
