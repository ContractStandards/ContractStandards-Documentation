# Managing Private Libraries

Admins have a number of options to control access to their Private Libraries and how their content is displayed to other users. Below is an overview of the different Private Library setup options and what they mean for users.

**Note**: All of these tasks take place in the Admin View, specifically in the "Settings" page. To follow along, navigate there now.

## Users

### Create a User

1. In the Settings page, select to the "Users" tab if not already selected.

2. In the top-right corner of the user table, click the New User icon.

3. In the menu, select "Create User."

4. Fill in all fields (Username, email, etc.).

### Bulk Create Users

1. In the Settings page, select to the "Users" tab if not already selected.

2. In the top-right corner of the user table, click the New User icon.

3. In the menu, select "Invite Users."

4. Paste in an email or list of emails (separated by a comma).

5. Select Organization Role for all emails in that list. See [Organization Roles](Organization_Roles.md) for roles and their permissions.

6. Click "Invite."

ContractStandards will send emails to all addresses the user listed. For new users, the email will contain a link to a user creation form. For existing users, the email will contain a notification that the user was invited to a new Private Library.

### Suspending Users

1. In the user table, select the far-right icon in a user's row (three vertical dots).

2. In the resulting menu, select "Suspend."

This prevents that user from accessing the Private Library but does not remove them from the Private Library entirely. This is useful if Admins need to temporarily deny access to a user but expect that user to regain access at a later date.

### Removing Users

1. In the user table, select the far-right icon in a user's row (three vertical dots).

2. In the resulting menu, select "Suspend."

This removes a user from the Private Library. The removed user will still have access to all Public content. If an Admin later wants to add this user back to the Private Library, they will have to go back through the invitation process.

### Resetting User Password

1. In the user table, select the reset icon in in the user's row (circular arrow).

2. Enter the new password and confirm.

3. Click "Save."

### Changing User Roles

1. In the user table, select the edit icon in in the user's row (a pencil).

2. Scroll to the bottom of the form and select a different role from the "Organization Role" field.

3. Click "Update."

## Organization Profile

1. In the "Settings" page, select the "Profile" tab at the top of the page.

2. Admins have the following options:
  * Name. Set the Private Library's name (e.g., Acme)
  * Organization Owner. Select a user from the Private Library that "owns" the Library.
  * Private Library. Make the Private Library public or private.
  * Display Comments. Turn comments on or off. See [Comments](Comments.md).
